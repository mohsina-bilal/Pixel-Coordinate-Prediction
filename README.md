# Pixel-Coordinate-Prediction

Using Deep Learning techniques, predicted the coordinates (x,y) of a pixel that has a value of 255 for 1 pixel in a given 50x50 pixel grayscale image, and all other pixels are 0. The pixel with a value of 255 is randomly assigned. The dataset is generated as required to solve the problem.
