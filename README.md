# Pixel-Coordinate-Prediction
Using Deep Learning techniques, predicted the coordinates (x,y) of a pixel which has a value of 255 for 1 pixel in a given 50x50 pixel grayscale image and all other pixels are 0. The pixel with a value of 255 is randomly assigned. Dataset is generated as required for solving the problem.
